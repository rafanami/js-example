Example in JS on how to refactor an imperative code into functional programming

This example simulates rendering a shopping cart page into console.
The shopping cart is created based on a list of selections passed to the renderPage function.

There are two main requirements to render this shopping cart:

## The total should be the sum of all item prices

## Right after the total, we should calculate the tax for the total on the shopping cart
